/**
 * This class provides a client API for all the GeoIP2 Precision web services.
 * The services are Country, City, and Insights. Each service returns a
 * different set of data about an IP address, with Country returning the
 * least data and Insights the most.
 *
 * Each web service is represented by a different model class, and these model
 * classes in turn contain multiple record classes. The record classes have
 * attributes which contain data about the IP address.
 *
 * If the web service does not return a particular piece of data for an IP
 * address, the associated attribute is not populated.
 *
 * The web service may not return any information for an entire record, in
 * which case all of the attributes for that record class will be empty.
 *
 * ## Usage ##
 *
 * The basic API for this class is the same for all of the web service end
 * points. First you create a web service object with your MaxMind `$accountId`
 * and `$licenseKey`, then you call the method corresponding to a specific end
 * point, passing it the IP address you want to look up.
 *
 * If the request succeeds, the method call will return a model class for
 * the service you called. This model in turn contains multiple record
 * classes, each of which represents part of the data returned by the web
 * service.
 *
 * If the request fails, the client class throws an exception.
