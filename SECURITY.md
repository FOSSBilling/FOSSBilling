## Reporting Vulnerabilities

To report a vulnerability, please make a submission on [Huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling).
Their website should give you a good idea on how to make a good vulnerability report.
It's important to make the submission there as it keeps the vulnerability private which helps ensure it can't be exploited while a patch is in the works.

If you have a suggestion that is related to security but not an actual exploit, then [creating an issue](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues/new/choose) on GitHub is a suitable place.

Usually a good report should include which file(s) has the exploit, how the vulnerability could be exploited, the potential ramifications of the vulnerability, a proof of concept exploit, and if possible insight into a solution.
A proper vulnerability report is awarded with a cash reward, if you provide a patch there is usually a reward with that as well.  

## Not a Vulnerability?

**Reporting bugs**
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for FOSSBilling.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report üìù, reproduce the behavior üíª üíª, and find related reports üîé.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one.
When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

**Note:** If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Before Submitting A Bug Report
Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

A detailed guide can be found here: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs). However if you're still unsure or it's too much to read drop a message on [Discord](https://fossbilling.org/discord). Sometimes it takes time to respond; please be patient!
