## Reporting Vulnerabilities 
To report a vulnerability, please make a submission on [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose). 
Enter https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling as the repository and then go from there. 
Their website should give you a idea good on how to make a good vulnerability report.
It's important to make the submission there as it keeps the vulnerability private which helps ensure it can't be exploited while a patch is in the works. 

If you have a suggestion that is related to security, then [creating an issue](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues/new/choose) on GitHub is a suitable place.

Usually a good report should include which file(s) has the exploit, how the vulnerability could be exploited, the potential ramifications of the vulnerability, a proof of concept exploit, and if possible insight into a solution. 
A proper vulnerability report is awarded with a cash reward, if you provide a patch there is usually a reward with that as well.
