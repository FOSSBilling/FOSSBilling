## What should I know before I get started?

### FOSSBilling structure

FOSSBilling is an open source project &mdash; it's made up of over [50 modules](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/tree/master/src/modules). When you initially consider contributing to FOSSBilling, you might be unsure about which of those 50 modules implements the functionality you want to change or report a bug for. This section should help you with that.

There are 2 types of modules:

* Service modules
* All other modules

Think of Service modules as products that you want to sell. These modules have actions related to product configuration. Lets say `Servicedownloadable` module allows you to sell Downloadable products such as e-books, images, photos, documents. Module keeps track of number of downloads, how many downloads were made.
If you need to sell new type of product you will implement Service type module.

Other modules extend whole FOSSBilling API with any functionality needed. Check existing modules to get the idea of what is already shipped with default structure of FOSSBilling.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for FOSSBilling. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Afossbilling)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which module your bug is related to, create an issue and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining what section exactly you used in the browser, or which API call you were using. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of FOSSBilling are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `https://<your domain>/api/guest/system/version` in your browser.
* **What's the name and version of the server OS you're FOSSBilling installation is running**?
* **What's the PHP version your server is using**?
* **What's the MySQL version your server is using**?
* **What's the Web Server and version your using**?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for FOSSBilling, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). 

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to FOSSBilling? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Good first issues][good first issue] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

#### Local development

FOSSBilling and all packages can be developed localy. Instructions on how to do this are provided in [Readme](README.md):

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain FOSSBilling's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible FOSSBilling
- Enable a sustainable system for FOSSBilling's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/.github/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/bug_fix.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
