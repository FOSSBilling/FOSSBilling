**FOSSBilling** is a free, open-source billing and client management system. It helps online service businesses automate invoicing, payments, and client communication.

- **Billing & Invoicing**: automated invoices, reminders, and basic reporting.
- **Client Management**: a central place for client data and communication.
- **Extensibility**: extension-friendly architecture for integrations and custom features.
- **Payments**: support for multiple gateways.
- **Translations**: community-powered, multi-language interface.
- **Responsive UI**: usable on desktop and mobile.
- **Security-focused**: built with security best practices in mind.
