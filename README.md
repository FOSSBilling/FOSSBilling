**FOSSBilling Laravel** is the planned long-term rewrite that will take place of the original FOSSBilling. The old codebase is forked from BoxBilling. We're planning to rewrite the software using Laravel. To speed things up, we need volunteers to help us plan, design and code the future of FOSSBilling.

This branch will eventually get merged with the main branch and we'll start releasing our Laravel builds. If you want to use FOSSBilling for your company right now, try the [main branch](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling).

## How to contribute?
### Plan
* Join our [Discord server](https://fossbilling.org/discord) and take part in the discussions.
* Comment on the [issues](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/discussions) on GitHub.

We're still in the very early phase of the software. Now is the best time to make radical decisions before it gets any bigger.

### Design
We need designers. Join our [Discord server](https://fossbilling.org/discord) if you're interested. Some of the things we need:
* A new admin theme
* A new client theme
* A new layout for [our website](https://fossbilling.org) ([source repository](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/fossbilling.org))
* Infographics and branding assets for our socials

We'll be using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) wherever we can. While the admin and client themes aren't ready yet, we're planning to make things simpler and stick to one framework everywhere and going forward that will be Tailwind CSS.

### Develop
We need developers.
As our team's experience varies on Laravel, we'll be needing a lot of help from the community. The rewrite is a long-term project and the main branch will have continuous developments and releases until we're confident with the rewrite.

While it might be confusing to have the issues for the main branch and the rewrite taking place in the same repository, we label anything related to the rewrite with [the "rewrite" label](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Arewrite). If you aren't sure where to start, or just want to take place in the community, [join our Discord server](https://fossbilling.org/discord).

The source code for the ongoing rewrite lies on this branch, the ["lara"](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/tree/lara) branch. We also will need help with these in the long-term:

* API wrappers for different languages
* Possibly a [command-line interface](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/cli)
* [Our website and documentation](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/fossbilling.org)

### Spread the word
Do you know someone who could help with the project? Invite them to contribute. New people will bring fresh perspectives to the project.

### Contribute financially
We collect donations and manage them transparently. All of our income and expenses are publicly listed on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/FOSSBilling). You can rest assured that your money is in safe hands. We usually use the donated money to cover infrastructure costs, buy new hardware and for marketing.

You can sponsor the project over [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/FOSSBilling). Thank you so much.
