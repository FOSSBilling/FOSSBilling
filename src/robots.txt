# e.g. www.example.com/boxbilling/ the robots.txt file MUST be
# moved to the site root at e.g. www.example.com/robots.txt
# AND the BoxBilling folder name MUST be prefixed to the disallowed
# path, e.g. the Disallow rule for the /bb-data/ folder
# MUST be changed to read Disallow: /boxbilling/bb-data/
